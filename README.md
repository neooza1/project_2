# Student Application Management System

## Overview
This project is a frontend JavaScript application focused on state management and CRUD operations.
It simulates how student applications are managed internally by allowing applications to be created,
viewed, updated, and deleted from a central state.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate system thinking, clear data flow, and state-driven UI
using vanilla JavaScript.

---

## Core Concepts Demonstrated
- Single source of truth (JavaScript state)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- State-driven UI rendering
- DOM as a projection of application state
- ID-based data management (no index-based logic)
- Clear separation between data, logic, and UI

---

## Application Entity Structure
Each student application follows this structure:

{
  id,
  studentName,
  studentNumber,
  faculty,
  course,
  status
}

---

## Features
- Add a new student application
- View all applications
- Update application status
- Delete applications
- UI updates automatically when state changes

---

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Git & GitHub

---

## Project Purpose
This project exists to prove understanding of frontend fundamentals, specifically:
- How data lives and changes over time
- How UI reacts to state changes
- How systems remain consistent through controlled state updates

This project is part of a progression from basic form handling to system-level frontend development.

## Status
In Progress
